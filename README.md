- 👋 Hi, I’m @samblam I am one of the software developers comprising the business solutions team for PPS. 
- PPS (Parliamentary Protective Services) is an entity of the Parliament of Canada created by law that is mandated to provide physical and network security for parliamentarians, employees, and visitors within the Parliamentary Precinct in Ottawa, Ontario.
- In this role, I head the analysis and construction of several in-house tools, as well as aid in process management and analysis. 
- My most impactful work to date was modernizing the tools used by the OPS training department for delivering course material, keeping track of certifications, and scheduling officer training sessions. 
- 👀 I’m interested in refreshing my skills in Python. Python was my first programming language, and I'm looking foreward to more advanced applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about blockchain development. I truely believe that we have barely scratched the iceburg in blockchain based tech.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I can at this point. All of my professional projects up to this point are covered by NDA's or Clearances, so I'm looking to expand my GitHub
- 📫 How to reach me via email at samuel.ellis.barefoot@gmail.com.
